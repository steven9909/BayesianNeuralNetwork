# bayesian-neural-net
This is an implementation of Baeysian Neural Network using Pyro, a probabilistic programming langauge.

It was trained on the MNIST dataset to show that it is able to converge. 

We also run inference on images that are not part of the MNIST dataset (CIFAR10) to show that the BNN is able to tell us when it is not sure of its classification.
